# COSMOSS 
COSMOSS = *Coupled OScillator MOdel Spectrum Simulator*

### DESCRIPTION
Given a molecule structure, this Matlab code simulate vibrational spectrum base on coupled oscillator model (Frankle Exiton Model).  

COSMOSS can be used to simulate:
* Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (FTIR)
* Sum-Frequency Generation spectrum (SFG)
* Two-dimensional Infrared spectrum (2D IR)
* Two-dimensional Sum-Frequency Generation spectrum (2D SFG)

Currently, COSMOSS supports the following structural construction models:
* Two coupled-oscillators
* Amide-I modes of peptide from PDB file
* 2D-Grid built from formatted quantum simulation outputs, such as Gaussian 09. 
* Amide-I modes of an ideal beta-sheet
* Combination of any two models above

This code is designed to be used for other molecules as well. You can generate your interested molecule and their spectra. Check the [documentation](https://hackmd.io/@jjh/COSMOSS)
 for more information.
