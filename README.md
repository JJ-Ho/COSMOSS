COSMOSS = Coupled OScillator MOdel Spectrum Simulator &nbsp;</p>

<p>Given molecule structure, this code can generates different kinds of vibrational spectrum&nbsp;<br />
base on coupled oscillator model. For now COSMOSS can be used to simulate:<br />
1. Fourier Transform Infared spectrum (FTIR) <br />
2. Sum-Frequency Generation spectrum (SFG) <br />
3. Two dimentional Infared spectrum (2DIR)<br />
4. Two dimentional Sum-Frequency Generation spectrum (2DSFG)</p>

<p>The supported molecule structure including:<br />
1. Two coupled oscillators<br />
2. PDB_AmideI<br />
This code is design to be used for other molecules as well. You can generate your interested molecule<br />
and their spectra. Please check sub-function in &quot;MoleculeConstruction&quot; folder for more infomation.</p>

<p>To use this code, please download it into your Matlab path and excute COSMOSS.m.<br />

Note:<br />
The GUI portion is created base on the &quot;GUI Layout Toolbox&quot; wrote by David Sampson.<br />
For this version (v0.6) you have to install this tool box to use COSMOSS. In near future,<br />
the Matlab default GUI layout will be supported, too.</p>
